### Current configs

- addPassthruCopy: icons, images, styles, js
- setDataDeepMerge(true) [11ty's docs ↗️](https:www.11ty.dev/docs/data-deep-merge/)
- using markdown-it, markdown-it-footnote, markdown-it-attrs
- customized collection that front-loads pinned material in the concepts section.

### Installation

After cloning repo, run `npm install` and wait for all node modules to be installed.

### Commands

```bash
npm run test #hello world equivalent
npm run develop #provides a server and live-rebuild environment on localhost:8080
npm run debug #runs DEBUG; uses globally installed debug package that spits out diagnostic info on the build process and any errors encountered
npm run newRecipe #creates new.md in drafts
npm run newConcept #creates new.md in drafts
npm run newDefinition # creates new.md in drafts.kitchen-glossary
```

## Blogging

### Front matter

Defaults found in their respective data file are shown in place. These terms do not have to be included in the front matter since 11ty's templating engine does this automatically. Types in comment as needed. I also have 11ty's `setDataDeepMerge(true)` so that nested collections inherit key-value pairs instead of overwriting them.

#### Recipe

```yaml
---
title: string
description: string
 date: leave blank or provide yyyy-mm-dd to override default date sort
layout: post.liquid
tags: ['posts', 'concepts']
sourceTitle: optional string
sourceURL: optional URL
sourceLicense:
  license: optional string
  URL: optional URL

```

#### Concept

```yaml

tags: ['posts', 'recipes']
sourceTitle: optional string
sourceURL: optional URL
sourceLicense:

```

```

### Inlining illustrations

This site nests illustrations inside the list items they support. This allows me to style the image without having to inline HTML in the markdown document. Images should appear before any words on the list item. This approach is not perfect because it does not take into account multiple pictures in close proximation of each other. Should it become a problem, it will be changed.

### Microformat friendly (not done)

This site will eventually use the h-recipe microformat. Doing so provides structure that allows search engines and extraction utilities to determine the type of information that on each recipe page. I'm still working out the specifics of my approach but it will most likely use a combination of markdown-it-attr and another parser to apply the classes that make up the h-recipe microformat to the appropriate elements on the page.

## TODO

- [tags ftw](https:www.11ty.dev/docs/quicktips/tag-pages/)
- Make nicer recipe.concept/definition generators
- Search/indexing
- How to journal in a recipe? Fermenation and bread experiments.
- Optionally link to cited source instead of always (forced to use anchor placeholder)
- Microformats
  - [h-recipe microformat](https:microformats.org/wiki/h-recipe).
  - [markdown-it-attrs documentation](https://github.com/arve0/markdown-it-attrs) 
- Nutrition API tie-in
