- 1/4 cup melted butter

### Filling

- 1 1/2 cinnamon
- 1 1/2 cups brown sugar

## Directions

1. Heat milk in a sauce pan until tiny bubbles form around the edge. Pour immediately in a bowl.
2. Stir in salt, sugar and butter.

8. Remove dough from bowl and punch down.
9. Roll out to 1/4 inch thick with a rolling pin into an approximately 8 x 12 in. rectangle.
10. Brush with melted butter. Sprinkle with cinnamon, brown sugar.
11. Roll up like a jelly roll starting with one of the longest sides of the rectangle.
12. Cut into one inch slices with a sharp knife.
13. Put rolls into a greased 9 x 13 inch pan.
14. Brush with butter and let rise one hour or until doubled in bulk (or you can refrigerate them at this point and take out to rise in the morning but it will take longer to rise if you do decide to refrigerate them).
15. Bake at 400 degrees for 15 - 20 minutes. Ice them and serve as soon as they are done.
