## Ingredients

### Wet

- 2 lbs 8 oz honey
- 1 gallon bottled drinking water
- 2 gr bread yeast
- 2 oz fresh ginger
- 3 sticks cinnamon
- 30 whole cloves
- 4 oz freeze dried raspberries
- 2 oz raspberry syrup

### Hardware

- fermentation vessels (I used 3 bottles of drinking water)
- funnel
- fermentation lock (I used a balloon with a pin prick)

## Instructions

_Note: aside from the honey, water, and the yeast amount, this is a fast and loose recipe. I did not have champagne or brewer's yeast so I used bread yeast. The accompanying flavors are what I had on hand for use._

1. Pour 1/2 water into stock pot and heat on high.
1. When barely simmering, add in all honey.
1. Mix honey until fully dissolved.
1. Turn off heat and let cool to 90F.
1. Peel and roughly chop ginger.
1. Crush freeze dried raspberries to a rough powder.
1. Distribute ginger, cinnamon, and raspberries to fermentation vessel(s). I used 3 1-1/2 liter drinking water bottles, discarding excess water beyond 1 gallon and an additional 4 cups to account for the honey.
1. Distribute water and honey mixture evenly between fermentation vessels.
1. Put on lids and shake to incorporate.
1. Distribute yeast to each vessel then shake again.

## Work log

_This is the first time attempting this recipe and is an experiement. I do not know if this recipe produces a quality product or I am going to end up with hootch. For this reason, I am keeping a log of observations._

- April 25th 2020: Recipe came together easily. I shook the bottles to redistribute the raspberries which kept floating to the top. Short of 2 hours, the bottles started to bubble lightly. The raspberry seeds were going on a fermentation bubble ride up and down the bottles.

- April 26th: Still bubbling lightly like it was yesterday.
