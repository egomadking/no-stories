## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 lbs tomatillos
- 1 jalape単o
- 2 poblano chiles
- 2 habaneros (if heat desired)
- 1 small sweet yellow onion
- 1/3 - 2/3 c water
- palmful cilantro, 80-90% of the stems removed
- 1 tsp salt or to taste

## Hardware

- 1 half sheet-cake size cooking sheet + liner pan OR
- 2 9" by 11" casserole dishes
- blender (or food processor)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400F.
2. Peel tomatillos and rinse any residual stickiness off in cool water.
3. Cut smaller tomatillos in half and larger ones in quarters.
4. Place them on cooking sheet or casserole dish.
5. ![jalapeno axis vs radius](/images/jalape単o-cut-radius-axis.jpg)Slice jalape単os in half axially. Remove seeds and stem.
6. Slice radially and throw on cooking sheet or baking pan.
7. Slice poblanos in half axially. Remove seeds and stem.
8. Slice the pieces twice radially and place alongside jalape単os.
9. Peel and quarter 1 small onion. Place with peppers and tomatillos.
10. Distribute vegetables evenly across the cooking vessel(s).
11. Place into oven for 15-20 minutes, or until vegetables start to blacken slightly at the edges.
12. Pull from oven and cool until no longer hot. Blending while still hot presents a burning hazard from spills and heats up the blending vessel so it is difficult to handle.
13. Prepare cilantro and place into blender or food processor.
14. Pour in 1/3 c water and put 3 or 5 piece of tomatillo in.
15. Blend on low to medium until cilantro leaves are flecks roughly the same size as crushed red pepper flakes.
16. Add in all chilis then 2/3 of the remaining tomatillos.
17. Blend on medium or high until all material is fairly well broken down and homogenous. Note: tomatillo seeds will not break down.
18. While still blending, add remaining water in small amounts. Stop blending periodically to test for desired thickness. Factor in that salsa verde will thicken slightly when cold.
19. Add in remaining tomatillos and blend lightly to get a chunkier salsa or thoroughly to have a smoother texture.
20. Transfer salsa to a sealable glass container. This recipe will fill 3/4 of a quart jar.
21. Use within 3 weeks, storing in the fridge.
