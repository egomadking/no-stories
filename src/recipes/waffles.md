## Ingredients

### Dry

- 2 c flour
- 2 tbls sugar
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt

### Wet

- 1 3/4 c milk
- 6 tbsp oil
- 2 eggs + 1 egg white, separated

## Directions

1. Combine dry ingredients
2. Separate whites from eggs into a clean mixing bowl
3. Combine wet ingredients (minus egg whites), avoiding excessive frothing
4. Combine wet and dry ingredients
5. Allow to sit for several minutes so flour can absorb moisture
6. Plug in waffle iron
7. Whisk egg whites until they have soft peaks
8. Stir 1/3 egg whites into waffle mix
9. Fold in remaining egg whites in 2 batches
10. Cooking times vary by waffle iron- start with 4 minutes, extend time for crispier waffles. Ignore the "done" LED on waffle iron. It is not as smart as you think.
