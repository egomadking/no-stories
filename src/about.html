<h1>about this site</h1>
<h2>
  Recipe stories can be tedious.
</h2>
<p>
  Sometimes the only thing needed is a recipe. This site is an uncluttered
  reference for those who need a to see a recipe while cooking. Even without the
  atmosperics of a lenthy tale, I guarantee that there is more than one recipe
  that has ruined a restaraunt experience for a friend or family member.
</p>

<h2>Not a profit-driven site</h2>

<p>
  Hosting is cheap these days so this site is a personal playtoy. Noone is
  paying for this site other than myself. Links or brands that appear on this
  site only because of a personal preference. If any of this were ever to
  change, it will be noted here.
</p>

<h2>Geekery</h2>

<p>
  I am using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> to build this site and
  hosting on Netlify. No frameworks were used because none were needed; there
  are several CSS resets in place but all other code on this site is my own
  devising. For those who are curious, you can see the site's Github repo here:

<h2>About me</h2>

<p>
  Born in '78, married, 1 kid, retired from the military, and a flat cap wearer.
  I'm highly inspired by the cuisines we experienced while we traveled abroad.
  Cucina povera of southern Italy, germanic dishes, and hungarian foods all have
  a special place in my heart.
