<h1>about this site</h1>
<h2>
  Recipe stories can be tedious.
</h2>
<p>
  Sometimes the only thing is needed is a recipe. This site is an uncluttered
  reference for those who need a to see a recipe while cooking. Even without the
  atmosperics of a lenthy tale, I guarantee that there is more than one recipe
  that has ruined a restaraunt experience for a friend or family member.

<h2>About me</h2>

<p>
  Borne in '78, married, 1 kid, retired from the military, and a flat cap
  wearer. I'm highly inspired by the cuisines we experienced while we traveled
  abroad. Cucina povera of southern Italy, germanic dishes, and hungarian foods
  all have a special place in my heart.
